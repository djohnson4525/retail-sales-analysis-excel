# Retail Sales & Customer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail transaction data to uncover sales trends, product performance, customer concentration, and geographic revenue distribution. The objective is to demonstrate practical, business-focused data analysis using Excel and Power Query.

## Dataset
- Online retail transaction data containing invoices, products, customers, prices, and timestamps
- Over 50,000 transaction records after data cleaning

## Tools Used
- Excel (Power Query, PivotTables)

## Key Analysis Steps
- Cleaned raw transactional data by removing canceled orders, filtering returns, and handling missing customer identifiers
- Created derived revenue metrics
- Analyzed monthly revenue trends, top-performing products, high-value customers, and country-level sales performance
- Built an executive-style Excel dashboard summarizing key business insights

## Key Insights
- Revenue peaked in November 2011, indicating strong Q4 seasonality likely driven by holiday demand
- A small subset of gift-oriented products generated a disproportionate share of total revenue
- The top 10 customers contributed approximately 17% of total revenue, indicating moderate customer concentration
- The United Kingdom accounted for roughly 82% of total sales, with additional contributions from European markets

## Deliverables
- Cleaned, analysis-ready dataset
- Excel dashboard with KPIs and visualizations
- Insight summary suitable for stakeholder reporting
